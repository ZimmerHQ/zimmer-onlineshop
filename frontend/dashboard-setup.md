
The full admin dashboard structure and all tab pages are now created, including:

- A sticky, responsive sidebar with all required sections.
- Pages for Messages & Users, Product Management, Orders, Human Support Requests, and Settings.
- Modern minimalist UI using TailwindCSS.
- Zustand for global state management.
- Routing and layout using Next.js app directory.

**Next steps:**
1. Install dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

Would you like me to provide the install command for you to run, or do you want to proceed with the setup? If you need any customizations or want to see a specific page/component, let me know!
